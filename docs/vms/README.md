# Virtual Machines

While starting virtual machines by using the [KVM Commands](../interacting/commands/kvm.md), we rather recommend to start virtual machines using the Orchestrator, as discussed in the tutorial [Boot a Virtual Machine using the Zero-OS Orchestrator](https://github.com/zero-os/home/blob/master/docs/tutorials/Boot_VM_using_Orchestrator.md).
